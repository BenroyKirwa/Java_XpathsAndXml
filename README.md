## Without using Xpaths:
```
a. Get all elements/attributes which have ﬁeld_type API_BASED. List them by their ‘tag_name’ attribute
b. Count all the elements which are ﬁeld_type TABLE_BASED.
c. Get all the elements which are to be checked for duplicates and the associated ﬁelds
d. Remove the XML elements RESTRICTED_ACCESS_NATIONALITIES_MATCH_TYPE,MAX_RESTRICTED_ACCESS_NATIONALITIES, RESTRICTED_ACCESS_NATIONALITIES
e. Update all elements where use=’MANDATORY’, to be OPTIONAL
```

## Using Xpaths to achieve the above as well.
